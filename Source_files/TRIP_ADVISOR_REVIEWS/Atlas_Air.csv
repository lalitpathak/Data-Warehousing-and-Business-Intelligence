Mediocre service on a half broken plane that smelled like exhaust fumes. Delays upon delays. Incredibly unreliable. Plus the food was horrible.

This company was hired to fly my husband's military unit back from a deployment. Apparently when they arrived to pick up the unit they had mechanics there, working on a repair before take off. When they landed at their layover destination, the mechanics-who had gone with them-found that the issue had not been successfully fixed and hours later determined it...

Reasonable ticket price, punctual flights, specious airplanes with comfortable seats and decent legroom. Flight attendants are polite yet could be friendlier.
The company is kind enough to offer us light snacks both ways morning and night despite booking economy class tickets.
N.B your likes are highly appreciated.

Flying from El Paso to Kuwait on a piece of airline junk! They had problems with the engines and the air conditioning on this plane. If the plane wasn't in the air, the a/c didn't work. There was no electric outlets to charge computers or to plug in CPAP machines. The food was absolutely horrid and wasn't fit for inmates...

We flew to Izmir with my family of 5. Inexpensive airline. Safe. Clean. More legroom than Pegasus airlines. It is so inexpensive to fly domestic in turkey ( especially compared to,flying domestic in the United States). Not as nice as Turkish airlines.

Atlas jet offers economical flights in the area as well domestic Turkish flights. The flight was basically on time, although some of the passengers were better left behind.

I flew on this airline because I wanted to fly to Istanbul from Luton for business. Budget airline price and the ticket was a bit confusing to understand. However once on board the cabin was a high standard and you got a meal and drinks service. I have never been on a flight with so many attendants the economy cabin...
