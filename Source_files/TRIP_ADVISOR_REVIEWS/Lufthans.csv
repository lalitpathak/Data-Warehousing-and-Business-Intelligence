A frequent flyer with over 140 flights for 18 months does not mean anything for Lufthansa and you can only hope not to be treated with questionable respect and pray to get a quick response to any customer service query.

they have unrealistic carry on sizes and weight which forces you to have to check a bag for a long overseas flight/destination.

They are not customer service friendly and I found some of the staff rude.

Lufthansa is a world-class airline, no doubt about that. Excellent ground services and in-flight services. This airline has always maintained very high standards. One weakness though is the food they serve in-flight. I know it is economy and I got a cheap ticket, but it does not cost to make the food a little palatable. They need to learn that...

Lufthansa is never too fast in catching up with the competition, but then they do it right. Latest example: premium economy. No longer compressed into that seating contraption of the regular coach class, which require several weeks of physical therapy afterwards, you now have leg room and movements in your seat do not have to be closely coordinated with the...

For the long flights, upgrading to Premium Economy was such a great idea. The seats were wider, and almost flat tilt feature which allows for great napping.

The seats on Lufthansa were wider than on planes bearing American branding. The food was surprisingly good. My wife has a tomato allergy and they were quick to find her something that she was able to eat. And wine was served in Economy.

I was surprised that Lufthansa would accept an international connection with only an hour in Frankfurt. I was flying from Philly to Moscow through Frankfurt.

Lufthansa economy class flights are a shadow of the service formerly delivered. In common with most airlines they have reduced catering to a sandwich and drink.

Lufthansa in business class, on long haul flights, offers a really professional service. You feel that they want you return to them again. Choice of foods and drinks was good both in lounges and on board. And configuration of business class seats created a feeling of privacy and care.
