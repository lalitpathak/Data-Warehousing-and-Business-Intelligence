The first flight we took gone well. But on the second (only 1 week later) they randomly changed the baggae rules and I had to bring my luggae with me on the plane. That ment that I couldn´t bring everything I wanted with me and had to throw one of the gifts from my trip to the trash. The flight...

rn630757885,Nice long delay with no information,"
We boarded early, because the airline opened the early. When everyone was on board we just waited and waited. About 15 minutes later there was an announcement, not loud or legible enough, something about ground control.- Then we waited some more and finally about an hour late we left.

I feel very unpleasant by service of this airline
Me and my mom went to the plane with our baggage, they told us there is no place for it so they will put it somewhere else. We trusted the stewardess and he took our baggage away. When we arrived to Rome we waited for our baggage and they told us...

Outward flight was a shambles- HANDWRITTEN boarding passes took 2 and 1/2 hours, then on boarding told to sit anywhere we could find a space as our pre-booked premium seats were occupied. They had NO IDEA if all the passengers had boarded.
Return flight- Laudamotion check in staff were the only example of poor customer service we met with in...

rn630239270,Vienna debacle,"
This airline failed to issue boarding passes and was forced to handwrite them resulting in a queuing time of two hours. Passengers at the end of the queue were forced to make a desperate dash across airport via customs to make the flight, as check in staff staff were not communicating with those at the gate some passengers missed their...

Me and my friend purchased seperate tickets for Laudamotion's flight leaving on the 19th October at 6am from Vienna to Chania, Crete, in hopes of a pleasant journey and good vacation in Greece for 6 days. I thought everything would be alright as I've flown with the same flight in July as well, had no problems then. But this time...

There's a lot of written that this airline is not good... I must say for me it seemed VERY GOOD, especially for the price.
- Each time I flew it was on time
- Crew was friendly
- Plane fleet despite its age looks very fresh
- For a lowcost airline the legroom is generous
That means no issues at...

Never having flown a European discount airline, we had concerns based on reviews. But we needed to get to Mallorca, and the flight from Graz on Laudamotion (now part of Ryan Air) offered the best option at a reasonable time of day and the bonus of low fares was certainly enticing. We decided to take a chance. We read about...

When we made the online check in, we received the information (also written on the boarding pass) that we can arrive at the check-in with two pieces of baggage. The smaller will be the carry-on bag, the bigger (max 10 kg, max 55x40x20 cm) will be labeled and put into the cargo, free of charge.

in Jul 2018 the flight from Palma to Berlin was canceled, still waiting for compensation.
The company proposed to change tickets to Dusseldorf instead of Berlin, and then transfer should have been provided (from Dusseldorf to Berlin). By the way ticket costs ~100 euro + trip time = 5 hours.
But, the company haven't provided any transfer, instead recommended to...

My husband and I took a short flight from Paphos to Vienna this month. Everything went right according to schedule, from the check-in through boarding and landing.

These planes are operated by Ryanair so be careful with your hand luggages as the rules are the same as Ryanair use. We ware lucky as without any additional fees they allowed our second baggades as well.

The airline itself is good, we had a flight in time, a good aircraft and so on.

A horrible ending of a great holiday. We arrived early, about 5pm for a 8pm scheduled flight. We were already told there was going to be a 1 1/2 hr. delay.

Well, we flew on Saturday September 15th after quite a storm near Ballearic Islands. After getting to airport we spotted all flights were either delayed or cancelled.

Laudamotion wrote me I could apply for refund online, unfortunately their refund process redirect you to Ryanair page, which accept only applications for Ryanair flights, so it's impossible to get a refund, and via email they never answer to me.
Since Ryanair is trying to be a barely respectable company they use Laudamotion for the scams.

Before boarding they labelled all luggage pieces (hand luggage!) to then sort them out and load them in the plane's trunk.
