I was really worried about flying with Norwegian as they have such bad press. I even found a whole Facebook page dedicated to sharing horror stories about them.

The Norwegian JFK personnel are very rude, disrespectful and lack of customer service. The counter personnel processed our paperwork, we had overweight on the luggage, we distributed the weight to other bags, however, on our return who assisted us was not on her spot.

We had to wait for two hours to pick our luggage and nobody came to inform us as to why we had to wait for that long. Even after all passengers started complaining they did not show up and left some airport contractors to deal with about 200 vey upset passengers.

Traveled to Singapore and decided to upgrade on both legs to premium economy.

We booked a last minute return flight and were delighted with what we got. A fraction of the price of other airlines, we didn't expect much.

Flew with my daughter for her 21st and as a special gift I booked Premium Economy as she is tall and has terrible trouble sleeping in Economy. I hadn't flown Premium economy before so cannot compare this but we had a great experience with Norwegian and I think it was what would be Business class on other airlines.

My wife and I want the extra room of premium economy services, which Norwegian offers, although at a steeper price than some others. But the space and service proved to be worth it.

No food, no free water, no drinks, no nothing plus our return trip to Seattle was canceled and we were obliged to fly home through Los Angeles. What only 5 additional hours in the air?

The back row provides extra leg room. The 787 dreamliner offers more humidity and fresh air to help combat jet lag. Low cost fare, plus extra for meals and checked bag, but still very reasonable. This airline is often late, which ours was, but on vacation, so no big deal.

I love this Norweigan plane. I had heard that the Dreamliner has a different air system and it seems to be true. We arrived after 9 hours of travel feeling fresh, with absolutely no jetlag. The food was good, the staff was efficient, maybe not the friendliest crew but very attentive.

We were not sure what to expect when we booked this flight, but as it was from Gatwick, near us and going to where we wanted to be and was cheap so we went for it.

My first long-haul air flight. The airplane was new and modern. Everything was fine except the fact that you need to pay expensively for anything onboard.

Cheap flights, even across countries. However, they cancel flights last minute, do not communicate with passengers, do not even bother asking if you want water if you don't buy food on the airplane, and are often late. The only reason I gave this high of a rating is their prices are impossible to beat by any other airline.

Norwegian knows how to treat their passengers giving them a version of low cost flying that doesn't feel a bit like you're with a budget airline. Inflight wifi, new aircraft, TV screens. I highly recommend this airline which I use for my Helsinki trips but will use to travel to North America in the future.

Usually I spend as much of the flight as possible standing to minimise cramp from the seats. No need at all with Norwegians seat pitch. The crew was fine and made repeated announcemts about my grandsons peanut allergy (which I suppose might be less wonderful for others). They treat you as a customer not self-loading baggage.

My first time with this airline.
Easy checking in, helpful staff and left on time.return flight was a slight delay but that was a London end problem and planes had to 'stack.'

All in all, very good.

For economy price of the airfare a very good experience. Staff was courteous and attentive and flight was smooth. Great choice of movies to watch food was okay for airline food.

First time flying with Norwegian and I was very pleasantly surprised.

Third time with Norwegian and first time with family. Flight from Copenhagen to Barcelona and return with new airplane more or less on time both ways.

Norwegian provide a good choice for families. We flew with our son, daughter in law and 3 grandchildren. The service is reasonably priced, efficient with nice leather seats.

Flew out to Malaga Airport for my surprise 50th birthday treat. (A week's holiday in Benalmadena to celebrate me reaching the ripe old age of 50)
From boarding the plane to leaving it, BOTH ways, the service was second to none. I'm a bit of a nervous flyer and I think the airline staff must have picked up on this....

On Dreamliner. Comfortable and roomy. tried to get extra leg room but didn't but actually didn't need it. Food fab, in flight entertainment good. Excellent staff on board. Out in 9.5 hours back turbo boost in 7 hours. When purchasing anything on board you swipe your credit card and leave it open until end of flight then you can order...

Everyone was absolutely pleasant and hospitable. The inside of the airplane looked brand new and extremely clean. The food was very good. I did not expect as many meals as I received. I was so impressed with the service, flight and hospitality.

rn346597121,An awful flight,"
We have been flying with many airlines but Norwegian is the most poor airline. It was a Dreamliner but it was so dirty at the seats and all over. When we took up the table from the armrest down at the bottom there old peaces of food an a lot of dust. The personel were very arrogant and made a...

rn346500233,Best flights are always with Norwegian!,"
This airline is always reliable and confortable. They don't pest you with constant announcements which is what I value the most apart also that you have free WIFII onboard which is quite useful.

rn346493376,BEWARE!,"
Great flight and food ( which was economically priced)
A very informative staff kept us posted in flight and we were so lucky to see the Nothern Lights from the air.
However on this aircraft seats 10A and 11F are not windows and I felt uncomfortable on return flight in 10A.
Also would not have seen lights had they been...

My wife and I made 4 flights with Norwegian. We went from Gatwick to Oslo, Oslo to Tromso, then back again to Oslo and finally from Oslo to Paris. Every flight was a little late, but not greatly so and on some we made the time back in the air. Loved the self baggage check in, as it worked extremely...

A brand new plane and considering they are the Norwegian equivalent of Easy Jet, this was a pleasant surprise.

Great flight, good service and what I loved most was the price. I have recommended Norwegian to my Latino family who thinks they could never afford a trip to Europe.
Thanks to you, my dreams came true.

rn346247862,Baggage lies,"
We were boarding in Rome for our return home to London. As we approached the plane, we were told by airline staff ""The over head lockers are completely full. We need to check your hand luggage into the hold"". Now, we purposely only took hand luggage to avoid waiting for our bags at the other end. We reluctantly handed over...

I fly to Malmö a day a week on average and I am usually on the flight that departs 0730 in the morning. No complaints about the aircrafts in itself but this flight is very often delayed due to the fact that it arrives from Helsinki before going on to Malmö and that must change so my recommendation is clear...

Bad let down, poor service in premium, actually no service at all, hostile cabin staff
although the aircraft was a Dreamliner -bad dream... But... you get what you pay for..

As it is often done I have booked my tickets via third party website - TripAdvisor. I did not get much information about reserving a seat, luggage or meal fees-all needed to be paid at a later time.This was not my biggest issue or concern.

We flew from JFK to CPH. It was certainly no frills. The outbound meal was not very tasty but on our return flight, we had salmon as one of the options. Was all set to catch up on some movies, but the selection was old and disappointing. Not a whole of space, but you get what you pay for. It...

As I booked my ticket online via a third party website, I did not get information about my allowed luggage, seat, and other services.

Great value for what you get. The seats were average (not the most comfortable but bearable), the food was good too however make sure you bring your own headphones, blankets and cushions as you have to pay extra for those!

Also make sure you check...

We flow Norwegian this past November, and it was largely a good experience. However, owing mostly we think to a poorly trained (or since it was a new service, inexperienced) counter staff) we were charged $100 for an extra bag that we didn't have.
