We were delayed at Gatwick 22/05/2016 no explanation given. Hence, I missed my connecting flight to Cuba.

We travelled with this airline (6 of us) on 31st May for 3 nights to Madrid and I can honestly say that animals going to a slaughterhouse would have had better treatment. Whilst I appreciate they are a budget airline, the passengers are still paying customers. We were over 90 minutes late taking off from Gatwick, there was no explanation...

I traveled with my wife on Air Europa from Rome to Miami with change of planes in Madrid. We were supposed to arrive to Madrid at 1:10 pm on Terminal 2.
