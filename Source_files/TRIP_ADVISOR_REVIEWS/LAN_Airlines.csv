rn548116387,Worst airlines service ever. ,"
My review is based on the service I got after my bag where missing for almost 3 days. For those of you who want the short version: LATAM can t give any information when bags are being dropped are your place when they locate those. That means:I had to stay the hole day and evening and night in my appartement...

We flew a total of 6 flights on our trip to south America, all on LAN or LATAN. I like the service and planes were newish Seats were average but not too close together in coach. Food was basic, but free beer/vine on international flights. I like the schedule from/to LAX overnight flights to Peru or Chile, regional flights. This...

rn506249707,i will avoid all LATAM flights,"
I booked this flight throush Sky tours and some how latam changed the flight time from 1 pm to 9am that morning. Latam says they notified sky tours, and sky tours says they did not get notified.
What that mean for me was sitting at the airoport for 9 + hours and losing a day with my family

The three flights were pretty good and the food was great, but there was a problem with my bag and Iberia was unable to retrieve it from Latam to send it to the final destination.

",Lan Colombia
rn486371631,Everything went as it should,"
Only negative thing was having to collect checked in bag at Lima just to check it back in again even if the airline was the same. Oh, and short legroom. Other than that the flight was smooth and the service good.
",Lan Colombia
rn468419357,"Reasonable price, but we bid and won upgrade to Premium class, it was worth the extra","
Bid on and got upgrade to Premium economy, so no hassle about 3rd bag, weight of other two bags, towel, drink, lunch, it was a cold lunch but good, and the wine was ok.

Flight 603 on February 27th was my first time with LAN aka LATAM airlines. My wife and I both think that the service, attitude and overall performance an outstanding experience.

We were very happy with this long haul from Auckland to Santiago. (We also had an excellent flight from Santiago to Lima on LAN.)

",Lan Colombia
rn401432385,Wonderful plane and service,"
We flew on the new 787, and it's a creampuff. We spent the night in comfy ""pods"" with fluffy comforters and plenty of leg room. The seats stretch out flat, and with earplugs and eye mask, it's lights out. The food was good for an airline-- not the equivalent of Air France, but nothing objectionable.

I must admit that I was somewhat wary of flying LAN CHILE AIRLINES based on opinions I had heard years ago.

We had a tour round Chile involving about 10 flights on LAN. Each one was on a very new, clean plane and every one was on time without any problems.

On the line for platinum members (with a companion) the attendant started to shout with us as if we were in the wrong line before asking if we were a platinum member (we were) or not.

rn401207672,Nice food!,"
Super impressed that the airline provides ""real"" cutlery i.e., metal forks and knifes and not cheap plastic. The food that was provided on the flight was very nice too and their fleece blankets and pillows were very comfortable. Great that the crew were quiet and ""left you alone"" when 99% of the passengers were sleeping. Flight was on time.

rn401167198,Space is a real premium,"
I would put this into the category of spending 13 hours in a sardine can. Many airlines are stripping valuable inches from economy seats to pack a few more in. Lantam have gone just about as far as they can although I suppose if they only allow passengers who are size 0 and 5 ft tall they can take out...

Reasonable comfort for a long flight. The hour of so's break in Auckland was welcome; food satisfactory; friendly service. A bit of trouble on boarding: there had been double-booking and this caused a delay. Probably not the airline's fault and ground staff were at pains to resolve the difficulty efficiently.

I always try to fly LAN, and in this case, I was not disappointed. Being locked up for 14, yes 14, hours inside a single aircraft with other 200+ people is something difficult. This is a very long flight, but I have to say I had a good experience.

This was €150 cheaper than other alternatives but not as cheap than other airlines i'd never heard of, so we chose lan. Not a bad pick. It seems to be the SAS of south America. An old but trusrty 737 flew us nearly on schedule. Friendly service. Al. Ok.
