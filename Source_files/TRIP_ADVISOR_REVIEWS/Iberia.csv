As usual, Iberia offers you horrible food for dinner and try to take you to your destination as fast as possible without troubles.

rn344849553,The Most Inflexible and Unfriendly Airline I've Every Used.,"
As a leader of a ski group, I have organized many trip for 12 to 120 members each year and never had the problems I had with Iberia for our winter 2016 ski trip to Spain. We had several name changes and two were done within our contract at no charge. All others were over $200 per. Not terrible, but...

This was a BA code share flight and if I had know it was Iberia maybe I would have tried to change it after reading some of the reviews. The cabin crew we missing for most of the overnight flight and people kept accidentally pushing the call button so the whole flight was kept awake with a consent ping ping...

I flew from London City airport which is always a joy to Madrid with BA to connect with the Iberia daylight service to Brazil. The Iberia aircraft was the updated A340 where business class is configured 1-2-1 so every seat has direct aisle access. The new seats are well designed and very comfortable giving good sight lines of an airy...

This was my connecting flight from Madrid to Rome, having arrived via Iberia 6250 from New York JFK airport. As I already had a boarding pass issued at JFK, I can't speak to the check-in process for this flight. The boarding process was very disorganized, with virtually no announcements throughout. There were clearly marked boarding areas based on row numbers,...

I have been a Golden Card Iberia frequent flyer for many years. Living in Spain and flying frequently to South America it was unavoidable. I have suffered this terrible company for many years. Two years ago I left my activities in South America and I swore: No more Iberia. Well, two years later (memory is weak!) I have flown again...

My recent flight aboard Iberia proved to be very good and pleasurable. The fact that I flew on New Years Eve contributed to the experience since both the airport and flight had significantly less travelers than normal. Check-in was a breeze and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. They voluntarily reassigned our economy class seats to give us...

rn343369806,They will take your money; cancel your itinerary and then charge you 4 times the amount to get a new flight itinerary,"
I booked an itinerary for $1000 with this airline and revised one leg of the itinerary to get an earlier flight; which resulted in having to purchase a new ticket. Their agent then deleted my entire itinerary; though I was not aware until I checked in for the next leg. They admitted it was their error, but then charged me...

This to me was great, first off not to crowded. I had been up for 16 hours before takeoff, so I crashed quick. The food was good better coming from Madrid Seats are comfortable for economy.

I booked my flight through Student Universe (NEVER AGAIN) and the flight was for Iberia from Florence to JFK. I booked my flight on November 20th and I was leaving January 1st to the 24th. They cancelled my return flight in the middle of my trip and Student Universe told me I had to arrange another one. I chose another...

rn342813064,Last in my airline-of-choice list,"
Where to start? The lounge in Madrid was completely overcrowded - no seats anywhere when we arrived and had to stand around like spare parts until we managed, in a race with other standees, to grab two. Food was very mediocre with indifferent staff.
The flight was in a very dated plane. The staff on board were great! The organisation...
